Predicting the Outcomes of Demo Calls for a SaaS Company. 



For this project I implemented a gradient boosted tree  model (XGBoost) to classify qualification of sales demo calls in order to improve forecasting efforts. This was the first time machine learning (or data science) techniques had been used in the company on something other than the product. 

I attained ~80% accuracy & demonstrated the value of implementing machine learning to solve low-hanging fruit problems on the business side. This demonstration lead the BI teamt committing to leveraging machine learning and data science for future initiatives.
